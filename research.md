I am a <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/research/academics/fellows/dr-holli-sargeant" target="_blank">Research Fellow in Law at St John’s College, University of Cambridge</a>. My work occupies the critical intersection of law and artificial intelligence. I study how algorithmic systems shape fairness, discrimination, and accountability, and how legal frameworks must evolve to ensure responsible and ethical AI deployment.

My research is inherently interdisciplinary, integrating methods from law, statistics, and machine learning with normative and economic theory. I focus on three connected areas:

1. **Responsible Regulation**

My research investigates the necessity for existing legal frameworks, specifically anti-discrimination and data protection laws, to adapt to high-stakes algorithmic decisions. I work to develop robust legal and technical frameworks that mitigate unlawful discrimination, support transparency and ensure accountability for high-stakes algorithmic decision systems.

2. **Access to Justice**

Beyond regulation, I study how AI tools are reshaping the justice system itself. This work highlights the tensions between rights-based approaches to justice and the pragmatic effects of deploying AI in legal contexts. I focus on how professional ethics and rule of law principles must guide the digitalisation of the justice system to ensure it remains centered on the interests of the people it serves, balancing efficiency with fairness and due process.

3. **Computational Legal Infrastructure**

To understand the law through computational and empirical methods, we need better datasets, tools, and legally-informed methods. I co-led the creation of the Cambridge Law Corpus, a large-scale, machine-readable dataset of UK case law [[Published at NeurIPS'23 ↗︎]](https://doi.org/10.5555/3666122.3667915). We continue to enrich this corpus with structured information to improve its utitlity for computational legal research.
