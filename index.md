<p>I am a <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/research/academics/fellows/dr-holli-sargeant" target="_blank">Research Fellow in Law at St John’s College, University of Cambridge</a>. I completed my PhD in the <a href="https://www.law.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.law.cam.ac.uk/people/academic/f-steffek/6136" target="_blank">Felix Steffek</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cam.ac.uk/people/academic/l-vinx/78311" target="_blank">Lars Vinx</a>, and <a href="https://mansmeg.github.io/" target="_blank">Måns Magnusson</a>. My thesis, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/604917dc-3b2b-44ad-a3c2-a09165d1f6f7" target="_blank"><em>Machine Learning in Consumer Credit: Legal, Economic, Ethical & Policy Implications</em></a>, examined the interaction between AI systems and consumer finance. It offered recommendations for regulation by analysing the economic incentives for using new technology alongside the normative and legal implications for consumers and other stakeholders. I completed part of my research as a <a href="https://www.law.cam.ac.uk/faculty-international-academic-links" target="_blank">doctoral exchange student</a> at Harvard Law School and an <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/holli-sargeant" target="_blank">affiliate</a> at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. My doctoral research was funded by a <a href="https://www.johnmonash.com/scholar/holli-sargeant/" target="_blank">General Sir John Monash Scholarship</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the critical intersection of law and artificial intelligence. I study how algorithmic systems shape fairness, discrimination, and accountability, and how legal frameworks can adapt to ensure responsible and ethical AI governance, including how to build robust frameworks for responsible AI design and deployment. I also explore AI's role in legal research and access to justice, including projects evaluating biases in legal datasets and the use of AI-assisted legal reasoning, research, and judicial decision-making. My work is inherently interdisciplinary and integrates methods from law, statistics, machine learning, normative, and economic theory to address questions of equality, transparency, and governance.</p>

<p>Before my doctoral studies, I practised as a solicitor at Herbert Smith Freehills and was seconded to the Australian Human Rights Commission, where I contributed to the <a href="https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/technology-and-human-rights/publications/final-report-human-rights-and-technology" target="_blank">Human Rights and Technology Project</a>. I hold an LLB (Hons) and BIR from Bond University, and a Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice from the College of Law Australia.</p>
